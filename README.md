# FixName cli-tool

author: @vishalx360

Have you ever downloaded a media file, whose filename is like 4_348907238948238.mkv ?? , and when you open in a player it shows the correct name.

FixName is a CLI-tool written in python which helps you fix/rename those files with the correct filename (if it exists in the metadata of the file).

```
usage: python fixName [FILE_NAME] file to fix.
-d specify a directory to perform fix process on .mkv files.
-h,--help to get this help-page.
```
